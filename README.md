- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew! I graduated with my BS in Mathematics and my MS in CS from UChicago in 2024, and I'm currently a software engineer at Discover working on backend Spring Boot apps. I love thinking about computer science systems, coding, riding motorcycles, mountain biking, traveling, backpacking, camping, playing board games, and rock climbing! I'm always happy to chat about any of my interests. You can reach me at: andrew.c2017{at}outlook.com
