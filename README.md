- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrew!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about computer science. I'm an undergrad at UChicago graduating December 2023; I was formerly a Math/Economics major, but I'm switching from Economics to CS. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about data structures and practicing my Java and Python skills!
You can reach me at: andrewchen{at}uchicago.edu
