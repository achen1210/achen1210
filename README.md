- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew! I love thinking about computer science systems, coding, riding motorcycles, mountain biking, traveling, backpacking, camping, playing board games, and rock climbing! I'm always happy to chat about any of my interests.
- I'm finishing an internship at Discover Financial Services doing backend API development, and Iâ€™m currently looking for New Grad positions starting Summer 2024! I'll be finishing my undergraduate degree in Mathematics at UChicago June 2024, and will be also getting a Master's in Computer Science as part of UChicago's Joint BS/MS program, also June 2024.
